  <h1>How to Play</h1>
  <p>
  <ol>
    <li>This game is meant to be played with friends via video chat. Have everyone join a google hangout or equivalent service.</li>
    <li>Include one additional person on the call that will screen share the board in full screen mode.</li>
    <li>This person will act as the board manager and will move the pieces, roll the dice and assign pies.</li>
    <li>Atleast 2 players must have a set of trivial pursuit cards. If everyone has a set, the game is more fun.</li>
    <li>Edit player names and decide who goes first.</li>
    <li>Read questions outloud to one another while the board manager keeps everything up to date</li>
  </ol>
  <h2><em>Optional Rules (Our House Rules because we arent that good at trivia)</em></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Our group has 5 different versions of Trivial Pursuit, ranging from a 1980s classic flea market find, to the modern genius edition. Since some questions are near impossible for us, we allow a person to skip any question they deem too difficult. If any other player can correctly answer the question, the player who requested a skip loses a pie and must finish their drink.</li>
    <li>Three correct answers in a row = social drink (everyone cheers and takes a sip).</li>
    <li>Each player can "phone a friend" in the game. We allow 3 of these per game.</li>
  </ol>
